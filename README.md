# 🎯 Get to 100 – Interactive Math Game

## 📌 Overview
Get to 100 is a fun, interactive, logic-based game where players compete to reach the number 100 using simple arithmetic operations.
The game allows multiple players, tracks their progress, and calculates their score based on how efficiently they reach the target.

Players start by entering a username and password, then join the game. Once the game begins, each player receives a number board with operation buttons to manipulate their current value.

## 🧮 Gameplay Mechanics
- Each player sees:
- Current Number (e.g., 92, 82…)
- Steps Counter (number of moves taken)
- Score (calculated based on performance)
- 
Goal:
➡️ Reach exactly 100 using the fewest steps possible.

🏆 Scoring Logic
- Fewer steps = higher score
- Score updates live while playing
- Each player plays independently on their own board
